                Hello, my name is Ali Sojudi and I am a UX/UI designer and web developer with almost 1 year of experience in the industry. I specialize in creating beautiful and user-centred designs for web and mobile applications, as well as building responsive and user-friendly websites. I have experience in creating wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes, as well as coding websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I always strive to understand the needs of the user, and I use data-driven insights to create effective solutions. I am always seeking new challenges and I am always eager to learn new design techniques and web development tools. If you are looking for a designer and developer who can help you create a user-centred product that meets the needs of your users and stands out from the competition, I would love to hear from you.
